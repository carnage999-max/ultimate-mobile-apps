ENGINEERING PLAN — Ultimate Mobile Apps Website
Purpose: clean, premium, fast, and structured hub showcasing all live apps with direct App Store / Play Store links. No complexity creep; focus on stability, clarity, and scalability.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE



Frontend


Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
